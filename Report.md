# Scan Matching Localization

AN ICP algorithm is implemented.

Initially the error did not lay below the required value, this was due to setting the epsilon low at 1e-6.


On the second iteration the the epsilon is set with more iteration. The max error was reduced to 1.66


On the third iteration, by tuning the parameters,
